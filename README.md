# monobehaviour_ext
 A simple tool.

I can't tell exactly what's this all about. But anyway, this is an extraction tool.

Maybe you'll want to use it with binary2text and WebExtract?
IDK. Perhaps that'll work, but perhaps not. I'm not sure about that.

P.S.
Maybe I should learn some C# anyway.
...Nah, not today.
